# Transcendia

> **Real-time Screen Translation for Games, Videos, and More**

Transcendia is a lightweight, privacy-focused desktop application that provides instant translation of any text visible
on your screen. Simply select a region, and watch as translations appear in real-time through an always-on-top overlay
window.

**Perfect for:**

- Gaming
- Streaming and video content
- Language learning
- Accessibility support

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Real-time OCR Translation**: Automatically detects and translates text from any screen region
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Works seamlessly across multiple monitors
- **Customizable Capture Regions**: Select any rectangular area of your screen to monitor
- **Configurable Intervals**: Set capture frequency from 1-60 seconds

### Customization Options

- **Text Styling**: Customize font size, color, and alignment (9 position options)
- **Background Effects**: Optional blur background with customizable colors
- **Multi-Language Support**: Translate to 17+ languages including major European languages
- **Always visible overlay**: translated text appears as a floating overlay window and clicks can pass through it

### Performance

- **Optimized OCR Engine**: Uses ONNX Runtime for fast and accurate text recognition
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Efficient background processing
- **Smart Text Detection**: Only processes changed text to reduce API calls

The app typically uses ~80 MB of RAM and up to ~80% of a single CPU core, so it runs smoothly even while gaming.

I'm working on even more optimizations for the next releases!
